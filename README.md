## Introduction

**COntaminated Derelict Radiation Impact** - just a project I run for my gf master's thesis. Basically it'll do following:
1. download raster data for required area
2. find basins and their coastlines with predefined accuracy
3. add some specific activity measurements bounded with derelict coastline
4. calcualate activity concentration & effective doses in point of interest due to wind uplift and transport
