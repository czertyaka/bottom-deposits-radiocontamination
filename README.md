## Introduction

**COntaminated Derelict Incipient Radiation Impact** - just a project I run for my gf master's thesis. Basically it'll do following:
1. download raster data for required area
2. find basins and their coastlines with predefined accuracy
3. add some specific activity measurements bounded with derelict coastline
4. calcualate effective doses in point of interest at the disaster initial phase due to wind uplift and transport
